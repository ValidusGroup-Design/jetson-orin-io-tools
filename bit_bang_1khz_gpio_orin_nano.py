# Bit-Banged GPIO Signal Generator for Jetson Orin Nano
# A Python script for generating square wave signals on GPIO pins using bit-banging.
# Configurable frequency and duty cycle, designed for applications like stepper motor control.
# Ideal for low-demand scenarios where precise timing isn't critical.
