============================================================================

Overview
--------

`jtop` is a system monitoring tool tailored for NVIDIA Jetson devices.
It provides real-time monitoring of CPU, GPU, memory usage, and other
performance metrics. This guide will walk you through installing and
using `jtop` on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.

Prerequisites
-------------

-   **JetPack Installed**: Your Jetson Orin Nano should have JetPack
    installed.
-   **Python3 Installed**: `jtop` requires Python 3.x.

Run `jtop` from the terminal:

    jtop
        

This command opens an interactive interface displaying real-time system
monitoring data.

Navigating `jtop`
-----------------

-   **CPU and GPU Usage**: View the CPU and GPU utilization on the main
    dashboard.
-   **Temperature Monitoring**: Check real-time temperature readings of
    your Jetson device.
-   **Memory and Disk Usage**: Monitor RAM and storage usage.
-   **Processes**: Inspect currently running processes and their
    resource consumption.

Use the arrow keys to navigate and press `Enter` for more details about
a selected component.

Step 5: Customizing `jtop`
--------------------------

`jtop` allows customization of its dashboard to focus on metrics
important to you. Use the following keys:

-   `t`: Toggle display of temperature.
-   `r`: Refresh data.
-   `q`: Quit `jtop`.

Step 6: Updating `jetson-stats`
-------------------------------

Regular updates to `jetson-stats` ensure compatibility with the latest
JetPack versions. Update using:

    pip3 install --upgrade jetson-stats
